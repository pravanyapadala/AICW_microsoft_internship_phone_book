Phone Book – Description
A Phone Book is a simple application used to store, manage, and retrieve contact information such as names and phone numbers.
It works like a digital version of a traditional contact diary.
🔹 Purpose
The main purpose of a phone book is to:
Save contact details
Search for a phone number using a name
Update or delete existing contacts
🔹 Features
➕ Add Contact – Store a new name and phone number
🔍 Search Contact – Find a phone number using the contact name
✏ Update Contact – Modify an existing phone number
❌ Delete Contact – Remove a contact from the phone book
📄 View Contacts – Display all saved contacts
🔹 How It Works
Contacts are stored in a data structure (like a dictionary in Python)
Each name acts as a key, and the phone number is the value
User inputs are used to perform operations such as add, search, update, or delete
